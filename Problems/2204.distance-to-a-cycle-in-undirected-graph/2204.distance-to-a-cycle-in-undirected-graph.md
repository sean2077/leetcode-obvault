## Description

No description

> [!tip]- Hint 1
> This problem can be broken down into two parts: finding the cycle, and finding the distance between each node and the cycle.



> [!tip]- Hint 2
> How can we find the cycle? We can use DFS and keep track of the nodes we’ve seen, and the order that we see them in. Once we see a node we’ve already visited, we know that the cycle contains the node that was seen twice and all the nodes that we visited in between.



> [!tip]- Hint 3
> Now that we know which nodes are part of the cycle, how can we find the distances? We can run a multi-source BFS starting from the nodes in the cycle and expanding outward.
