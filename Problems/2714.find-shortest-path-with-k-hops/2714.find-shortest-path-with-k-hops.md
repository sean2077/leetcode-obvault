## Description

No description

> [!tip]- Hint 1
> Let's construct a new graph and run Dijkstra on it to get the answer to the problem.



> [!tip]- Hint 2
> We define the new graph as follows: Each node of this graph is a pair (v, c) where v is a node from the given graph and c is any number between 0 and k (inclusive).



> [!tip]- Hint 3
> Try to make edges of the defined graph in such a way that if we run Dijkstra on the node (s, 0), then the shortest path to node (d, k) would be the final answer.



> [!tip]- Hint 4
> Edge type one: If the edge (v, u, w) belongs to the initial graph, we put an edge with the weight of w between nodes (v, c) and (u, c) for any c between 0 and k (inclusive) in the new graph.



> [!tip]- Hint 5
> Edge type two: If the edge (v, u, w) belongs to the initial graph, we put an edge with the weight of 0 between nodes (v, c) and (u, c + 1), also between (u, c) and (v, c + 1) for any c between 0 and k - 1 (inclusive) in the new graph.



> [!tip]- Hint 6
> For the matter of time complexity, note that you **don’t need** to literally construct the described graph.
