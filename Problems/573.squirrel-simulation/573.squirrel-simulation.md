No description

> [!tip]- Hint 1
> Will Brute force solution works here? What will be its complexity?



> [!tip]- Hint 2
> Brute force definitely won't work here. Think of some simple solution. Take some example and make some observations.



> [!tip]- Hint 3
> Will order of nuts traversed by squirrel is important or only first nut traversed by squirrel is important?



> [!tip]- Hint 4
> Are there some paths which squirrel have to cover in any case? If yes, what are they?



> [!tip]- Hint 5
> Did you notice only first nut traversed by squirrel matters? Obviously squirrel will choose first nut which will result in minimum distance.
