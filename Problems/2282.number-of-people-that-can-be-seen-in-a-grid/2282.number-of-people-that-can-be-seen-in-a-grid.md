> [!tip]- Hint 1
> Imagine you are looking to the right. The heights of the people you see form an ascending sequence.



> [!tip]- Hint 2
> Iterate through the row from right to left. Use a decreasing monotonic stack to keep track of the people that you can see.



> [!tip]- Hint 3
> Use binary search to find the number of people in the stack that are shorter than the current person.



> [!tip]- Hint 4
> Repeat this process for each column.
